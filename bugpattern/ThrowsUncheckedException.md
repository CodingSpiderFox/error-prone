## The problem
[Effective Java 3rd Edition ยง74][ej3e-74] says:

> Use the Javadoc `@throws` tag to document each exception that a method can
> throw, but do *not* use the `throws` keyword on unchecked exceptions.

## Suppression
Suppress false positives by adding the suppression annotation `@SuppressWarnings("ThrowsUncheckedException")` to the enclosing element.
